# Architecture

GitHub Copilot can be a powerful tool for facilitating architecture discussions and generating boilerplate code for architectural patterns. 
Below is an example of how GHCP can assist in creating a simple architecture for a Next.js application.

## Example: Creating a Service Layer

Suppose you want to implement a service layer to handle business logic in your Next.js application. GHCP can help you generate a TypeScript service class with proper structure and error handling.

### How GHCP Helps
- **Code Generation**: GHCP can generate the boilerplate for the service class, including methods and error handling.
- **Type Safety**: It ensures the code adheres to TypeScript best practices by suggesting type definitions.
- **Error Handling**: GHCP can include robust error-handling mechanisms in the generated code.

This example demonstrates how GHCP can accelerate development and maintain high code quality in architectural components.

### Task:
Open the Copilot Chat inside Visual Studio Code an try the following prompt:

| "I want to create a Service Layer for my Users API."
