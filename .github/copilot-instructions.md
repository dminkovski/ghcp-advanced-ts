   - Avoid generating insecure or inefficient code.
2. **Testing**:
   - When asked, generate unit tests using Jest and Cypress E2E, following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
   - Ensure tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases as well.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Include comments in generated code when appropriate to explain functionality.
   - Use JSDoc-style comments.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Suggest robust error-handling mechanisms where applicable.
   - Avoid generating code that could lead to unhandled exceptions.
5. **Refactoring**:
   - When requested, refactor code for readability, maintainability, or performance improvements.
   - Always preserve the original functionality during refactoring.

## Specific Instructions
- **File Structure**: Understand the repository's folder structure and suggest file paths or imports accordingly.
- **Naming Conventions**: Follow the naming conventions used in the repository for variables, functions, and files.
